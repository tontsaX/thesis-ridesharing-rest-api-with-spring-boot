This project is a REST API for an imagenary ridesharing application and it is the practice part of my thesis. 
<br>
<br>
The original idea was to create a REST service and a mobile app as my thesis, but the thesis goal is changed to contain only the REST service.
I came in the conclusion that programming a REST API and writing about the process, tests, useage and science behind the service can be tied easier together
than trying to write about two separate applications.
